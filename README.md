### Expo CLI is a command-line utility that allows you to use Expo tools. You can use it to create a new React Native project, develop and test your mobile app, build and publish your app to the App and Play Stores, etc.
     ### npm install -g expo-cli

### You can run on your web browser, your phone by enabling developer tools and connecting to computer or usinf expo go app by scanning the QR code shown on terminal or web browser.

## For a new React Native App Starter:
